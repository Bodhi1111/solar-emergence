# SOLAR EMERGENCE 🌟

**Emergent Intelligence Discovery System for Estate Planning Sales Intelligence**

![ci](https://github.com/Bodhi1111/solar-emergence/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Core Vision

SOLAR EMERGENCE represents a groundbreaking application of emergent intelligence to estate planning sales meetings discovery. This system embodies a discovery-first architecture that parallels DeepMind's AlphaGo approach - but instead of discovering Go strategies, it discovers sales strategies and human behavioral patterns.

## Core Principles (Immutable)

- **DISCOVERY_FIRST**: Let mathematics reveal patterns, don't dictate them
- **LOCAL_ONLY**: Everything runs on Mac M2 Max, no cloud dependencies
- **ZERO_COST**: No paid APIs, services, or subscriptions
- **EMERGENT**: Patterns emerge from data, not from predefined rules
- **SEQUENTIAL**: Each video builds on previous intelligence
- **MULTIMODAL**: All signals matter equally until proven otherwise

## Architecture

**4-Layer Emergent Intelligence System:**

1. **High-Fidelity Sensorium**: Unfiltered multimodal capture (468 facial landmarks, 43 AUs, 33 pose points)
2. **Multidimensional Representation**: Knowledge graphs + latent spaces
3. **Discovery Engine**: GNNs, TDA, multi-agent discovery system
4. **Evolution Loop**: Continuous learning with schema evolution

## Quick Start ($0 Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Mac M2 Max with 32GB RAM
- macOS 13+ (Ventura)
- Docker Desktop
- Homebrew

### 1. One-Click Local Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Bodhi1111/solar-emergence.git
cd solar-emergence

# Install dependencies (all free)
pip3 install -r requirements-ml.txt
npm install

# Launch complete system
./scripts/launch_intelligence.sh
```

### 2. Monitor Real-Time Discovery

```bash
# In another terminal - watch patterns emerge
python3 scripts/monitor_emergence.py --realtime
```

### 3. Test Single Video

```bash
# Test with sample video
python3 extraction/unconstrained_capture.py --test
```

## What This System Discovers

**Example Pattern Discoveries:**
- "Eyebrow AU2 activation at 43.2s + shoulder rotation = 89% close rate"
- "Silence pattern: 3.1s after benefit mention = processing, 7.2s = objection forming"  
- "Breathing synchrony between participants at minute 12 = decision alignment"
- "Left shoulder drop of 2.1cm at minute 43 = 89% close rate"

## Cost Comparison

| Component | Cloud Cost | Local Cost |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| AI Processing | $3-15/1M tokens | $0 |
| Vector Database | $70-280/month | $0 |
| Graph Database | $65-200/month | $0 |
| Video Processing | $0.10-0.50/minute | $0 |
| **Total Monthly** | **$160-550** | **$0** |

## Technology Stack (100% Free)

- **AI Engine**: Apple MLX Framework (Mistral-7B, Whisper, Phi-3.5)
- **Vision**: OpenCV + MediaPipe (468 landmarks, 43 AUs)
- **Audio**: Whisper.cpp + librosa (local transcription)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL + pgvector, Neo4j, Qdrant
- **Processing**: FFmpeg with VideoToolbox acceleration
