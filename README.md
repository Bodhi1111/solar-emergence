## Core Vision

SOLAR EMERGENCE represents a groundbreaking application of emergent intelligence to estate planning sales meetings discovery. This system embodies a discovery-first architecture that parallels DeepMind's AlphaGo approach - but instead of discovering Go strategies, it discovers sales strategies and human behavioral patterns.

## Core Principles (Immutable)

- **DISCOVERY_FIRST**: Let mathematics reveal patterns, don't dictate them
- **LOCAL_ONLY**: Everything runs on Mac M2 Max, no cloud dependencies
- **ZERO_COST**: No paid APIs, services, or subscriptions
- **EMERGENT**: Patterns emerge from data, not from predefined rules
- **SEQUENTIAL**: Each video builds on previous intelligence
- **MULTIMODAL**: All signals matter equally until proven otherwise

## 🧠 Revolutionary Architecture: EH²SMAS

SOLAR EMERGENCE implements the world's first **Emergent Holarchical Stigmergic Multi-Agent System (EH²SMAS)** for behavioral intelligence discovery.

### Key Innovations
- **Holarchical Structure**: 511+ specialized agents (468 facial + 43 action units) organized in corporate hierarchy
- **Stigmergic Intelligence**: Sequential learning across 1,500+ videos with persistent intelligence accumulation  
- **Emergent Discovery**: System discovers unprogrammed behavioral patterns invisible to humans
- **Multi-Level Selection**: Intelligence emerges simultaneously at agent, department, division, and executive levels

🔬 **Research Contribution**: First application of holarchical stigmergic principles to multimodal behavioral analysis

📖 **Full Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete EH²SMAS specification

```

## Quick Start ($0 Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Mac M2 Max with 32GB RAM
- macOS 13+ (Ventura)
- Docker Desktop
- Homebrew

### 1. One-Click Local Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Bodhi1111/solar-emergence.git
cd solar-emergence

# Install dependencies (all free)
pip3 install -r requirements-ml.txt
npm install

# Launch complete system
./scripts/launch_intelligence.sh
```

### 2. Monitor Real-Time Discovery

```bash
# In another terminal - watch patterns emerge
python3 scripts/monitor_emergence.py --realtime
```

### 3. Test Single Video

```bash
# Test with sample video
python3 extraction/unconstrained_capture.py --test
```

## What This System Discovers

**Example Pattern Discoveries:**
- "Eyebrow AU2 activation at 43.2s + shoulder rotation = 89% close rate"
- "Silence pattern: 3.1s after benefit mention = processing, 7.2s = objection forming"  
- "Breathing synchrony between participants at minute 12 = decision alignment"
- "Left shoulder drop of 2.1cm at minute 43 = 89% close rate"

## Cost Comparison

| Component | Cloud Cost | Local Cost |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| AI Processing | $3-15/1M tokens | $0 |
| Vector Database | $70-280/month | $0 |
| Graph Database | $65-200/month | $0 |
| Video Processing | $0.10-0.50/minute | $0 |
| **Total Monthly** | **$160-550** | **$0** |
