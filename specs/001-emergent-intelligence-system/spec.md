## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Sales professionals need to understand the hidden dynamics and success patterns in their client interactions that are invisible to human observation and traditional analytics. The system must develop its own "algorithmic awareness" to discover novel insights about what truly drives sales outcomes, going beyond predefined metrics to uncover emergent patterns in the complete interaction context.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a sales professional uploads a client meeting recording, **When** the system processes the multimodal data (audio, video, metadata), **Then** the system captures all interaction signals with temporal synchronization and minimal interpretation loss
2. **Given** the system has processed 100+ interactions, **When** analyzing a new meeting, **Then** the system identifies previously unknown patterns and correlations that predict outcomes better than traditional scoring methods
3. **Given** the system discovers a novel behavioral pattern, **When** the pattern proves predictive across multiple interactions, **Then** the system automatically evolves its understanding schema to include this as a new discovery category
4. **Given** a sales professional queries about successful interaction patterns, **When** the system responds, **Then** it provides insights about multidimensional relationships (temporal, financial, relational, psychological) that humans cannot detect manually

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multimodal data is incomplete (audio-only, poor video quality)?
- How does the system handle privacy-sensitive discussions or confidential client information?
- What occurs when the system discovers contradictory patterns or false correlations?
- How does the system maintain performance as the knowledge base grows exponentially?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Layer 1: High-Fidelity Sensorium (Profound Breadth)
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture unfiltered multimodal data including audio (vocal features, prosody, stress patterns), video (facial expressions, posture, environmental context), and metadata with minimal preprocessing
- **FR-002**: System MUST synchronize all captured signals to a unified timeline with microsecond precision to preserve interaction sequence relationships
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve raw signal fidelity without pre-labeling or interpretation to allow emergent intelligence to define meaning contextually

#### Layer 2: Multidimensional Representation (Algorithmic Awareness)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a dynamic knowledge graph representing interactions across temporal, financial, relational, and psychological planes simultaneously
- **FR-005**: System MUST create high-dimensional latent space representations that capture implicit structures and hidden variables governing interaction outcomes
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable real-time querying of both explicit relationships (knowledge graph) and implicit patterns (latent space) with sub-second response times

#### Layer 3: Discovery Engine (Pattern Emergence)
- **FR-007**: System MUST autonomously explore multidimensional data to identify previously unknown patterns, correlations, and structural relationships without explicit programming
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate novel hypotheses about sales success factors based on discovered patterns and automatically validate these hypotheses against historical data
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect anomalies, clusters, and persistent topological structures in interaction data that indicate meaningful but hidden success factors

#### Layer 4: Evolution Loop (Continuous Learning)
- **FR-010**: System MUST process new interactions in the context of all previous learning, with each new meeting analyzed against the evolving knowledge base
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically promote validated discovery patterns to explicit knowledge structures, evolving its own understanding schema
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide sequential ingestion capabilities where Meeting #N benefits from accumulated intelligence from Meetings #1 through #N-1

### Performance & Scale Requirements
- **FR-013**: System MUST process new interactions within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable latency threshold] of upload completion
- **FR-014**: System MUST scale to handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target number of concurrent users and interactions per day]
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain discovery accuracy and novel pattern detection as the knowledge base grows beyond 10,000 processed interactions

### Integration & Privacy Requirements
- **FR-016**: System MUST integrate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific CRM systems and data sources]
- **FR-017**: System MUST comply with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific privacy regulations and data handling requirements]
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide audit trails for all discoveries and pattern validations for regulatory compliance

### Key Entities

- **Interaction**: Complete multimodal record of a sales meeting including synchronized audio, video, metadata, participants, and outcome data
- **Knowledge Graph**: Dynamic, evolving representation of explicit relationships across temporal, financial, relational, and psychological dimensions
- **Latent Space**: High-dimensional mathematical representation capturing implicit structures and hidden variables in interaction data  
- **Pattern Discovery**: Autonomous identification of novel correlations, structures, or behavioral signatures that predict outcomes
- **Hypothesis**: Generated theory about sales success factors based on discovered patterns, subject to validation
- **Evolution Event**: System-initiated update to its own understanding schema based on validated discoveries
- **Discovery Agent**: Autonomous component responsible for exploring specific aspects of the multidimensional data space
- **Emergent Concept**: New understanding category that the system creates and validates independently of human-defined features
