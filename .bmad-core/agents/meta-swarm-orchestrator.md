## Bleeding-Edge Techniques

### Tree of Thoughts + Swarm Reasoning
```python
class SwarmTreeOfThoughts:
    def collective_reasoning(self, problem):
        # Each agent explores different thought branches
        branches = self.agents.parallel_explore(problem)
        # Swarm evaluates and prunes branches collectively
        best_paths = self.swarm_consensus_prune(branches)
        # Emergent solution synthesis
        return self.emergent_synthesis(best_paths)
```

### Multi-Agent Debate + Convergence
```python
class SwarmDebateSystem:
    def adversarial_refinement(self, proposal):
        # Agents take different positions
        positions = self.assign_perspectives(proposal)
        # Structured debate rounds
        refined_proposal = self.debate_rounds(positions)
        # Convergence to optimal solution
        return self.consensus_convergence(refined_proposal)
```

### Emergent Specialization
```python
class DynamicSpecialization:
    def adaptive_expertise(self, task_history):
        # Agents develop expertise based on performance
        specializations = self.analyze_agent_strengths(task_history)
        # Dynamically adjust agent capabilities
        self.evolve_agent_roles(specializations)
        # Spawn new specialists for emerging needs
        return self.spawn_needed_specialists()
```
