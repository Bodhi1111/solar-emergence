# Enhanced BMAD Master Agent

This enhanced version of the BMAD Master agent includes knowledge integration capabilities from the Solar Emergence project.

## Knowledge Integration

The agent now has access to:
- **106 knowledge items** from validated corpus processing
- **Local processing algorithms** (including Whisper.cpp)
- **Pattern discovery techniques** (GNN, TDA, UMAP)
- **Fusion architectures** for multimodal processing
- **Constraint compliance validation**

## Available Knowledge Categories

### Discovered Patterns (15+ items)
- GNN/Pattern Discovery: GNN Survey, Self-supervised Learning, TDA, UMAP
- Core AI/ML: Transformer, AlphaGo Zero, Meta-learning, Emergent Tool Use
- Pattern recognition and discoverability techniques

### Local Algorithms (19+ items)
- Whisper.cpp (local speech processing)
- Local architecture processing for video data
- Emergent pattern discovery algorithms
- Speech processing and diarization methods

### Fusion Architectures (56+ items)
- Layered fusion modules and meta-data processing
- Multimodal ecosystem architectures
- Component-based system designs
- Hardware-aware neural architecture search

### Core Principles
- **DISCOVERY_FIRST**: Prioritize discovering patterns before implementation
- **LOCAL_ONLY**: All processing must be local, no external APIs
- **ZERO_COST**: Only use free, open-source tools and methods
- **EMERGENT**: Focus on emergent behavior and intelligence
- **SEQUENTIAL**: Build knowledge sequentially and systematically
- **MULTIMODAL**: Process multiple data modalities (text, audio, vision, temporal)

## Using Knowledge in Agent Tasks

### Example 1: PRD Generation with Knowledge Context
```javascript
const { KnowledgeLoader } = require('./.bmad-core/utils/knowledge-loader.js');

// Load knowledge for PRD context
const knowledgeLoader = new KnowledgeLoader();
const localAlgorithms = knowledgeLoader.getLocalAlgorithms();
const fusionArchitectures = knowledgeLoader.getFusionArchitectures();
const corePronciples = knowledgeLoader.getCorePronciples();

// Generate PRD with discovered knowledge
const prdContext = {
  availableTools: localAlgorithms,
  architecturalOptions: fusionArchitectures,
  designPrinciples: corePronciples,
  constraintCompliance: true
};
```

### Example 2: Architecture Planning with Constraint Validation
```javascript
// Check if a proposed solution is constraint-compliant
const proposedSolution = "Use OpenAI API for processing";
const isCompliant = knowledgeLoader.isConstraintCompliant(proposedSolution);

if (!isCompliant) {
  // Suggest local alternatives
  const localAlternatives = knowledgeLoader.searchKnowledge('local processing');
  console.log('Suggested local alternatives:', localAlternatives);
}
```

### Example 3: Pattern Discovery Guidance
```javascript
// Get pattern discovery techniques for implementation guidance
const patternTechniques = knowledgeLoader.getPatternDiscoveryTechniques();
const gnndiscovery = knowledgeLoader.searchKnowledge('GNN');

// Use these to guide architecture decisions
const recommendedApproach = {
  patternDiscovery: patternTechniques,
  gnnMethods: gnndiscovery.patterns,
  implementationConstraints: knowledgeLoader.getCorePronciples()
};
```

## Enhanced Agent Capabilities

With integrated knowledge, this agent can now:

1. **Generate constraint-compliant PRDs** that only include local, zero-cost solutions
2. **Validate architectural decisions** against discovered patterns and principles
3. **Recommend specific tools and techniques** from the validated knowledge corpus
4. **Ensure emergent behavior focus** in all design decisions
5. **Leverage multimodal processing insights** for comprehensive solutions

## Knowledge-Driven Workflows

### Workflow 1: Discovery-First Architecture Design
1. Load discovered patterns relevant to the problem domain
2. Identify constraint-compliant local processing options
3. Select fusion architectures that support emergent behavior
4. Validate all choices against core principles
5. Generate architecture specification with knowledge references

### Workflow 2: Constraint-Validated Implementation Planning
1. Parse requirements for potential constraint violations
2. Search knowledge corpus for compliant alternatives
3. Generate implementation plan using only validated techniques
4. Include specific tool recommendations (e.g., Whisper.cpp for speech)
5. Create verification checklist based on core principles

## Available Knowledge APIs

The agent has access to these knowledge loader methods:

- `loadKnowledgeContext()` - Full knowledge context
- `getDiscoveredPatterns(category)` - Filtered pattern discovery
- `getLocalAlgorithms()` - Constraint-compliant algorithms
- `getFusionArchitectures()` - Multimodal processing architectures
- `isConstraintCompliant(technique)` - Validation check
- `searchKnowledge(term)` - Cross-category search
- `getProjectStatus()` - Current state and next steps

## Integration Benefits

This knowledge integration provides:

✅ **Validated Knowledge Base**: 106 items from processed corpus
✅ **Constraint Enforcement**: Automatic compliance checking
✅ **Local-First Recommendations**: Only suggests local processing tools
✅ **Pattern-Driven Design**: Uses discovered patterns to guide decisions
✅ **Emergent Behavior Focus**: Aligns all outputs with emergence goals
✅ **Zero-Cost Solutions**: Ensures all recommendations are free/open-source

The agent is now equipped to generate PRDs, architecture specs, and implementation plans that are fully aligned with the Solar Emergence project's principles and constraints.
