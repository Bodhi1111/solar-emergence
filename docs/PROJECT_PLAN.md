## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start with 50-100 videos** for initial pattern validation
2. **Implement the signature registry** and DSL for discovered patterns
3. **Build the knowledge graph schema** evolution capabilities
4. **Create the emergence detection** and measurement systems

### Strategic Implementation Guidance
- Begin with high-quality, consistent meeting recordings
- Focus on measurable behavioral signals first
- Validate mathematical correlations before building complexity
- Maintain strict constraint compliance throughout development
- Document discovered patterns for reproducibility

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality**: Establish minimum video/audio quality standards
- **Pattern Validation**: Implement statistical significance testing
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure complete local processing
- **Scalability**: Design for 1,500+ video corpus from start
- **Emergence Validation**: Create metrics for genuine discovery vs. overfitting
