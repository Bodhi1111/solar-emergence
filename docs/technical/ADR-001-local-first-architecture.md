# ADR-001: Local-First Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
SOLAR EMERGENCE requires a complete intelligence emergence system that discovers patterns in multimodal data. The system must operate without any external dependencies, APIs, or recurring costs while maintaining high performance on Mac M2 Max hardware.

## Decision
We will implement a fully local-first architecture where all processing, storage, and computation happens on the user's Mac M2 Max hardware with zero external dependencies.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Zero operational costs forever
- Complete data privacy and security
- Unlimited experimentation without rate limits
- No network latency for processing
- Full control over the entire stack
- No vendor lock-in

### Negative
- Limited to local hardware capabilities
- No distributed processing options
- Manual updates required
- No cloud backup by default
- Single point of failure

## Implementation
- All ML models run via MLX framework
- Databases containerized with Docker
- Video/audio processing via local libraries
- No network calls except localhost

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Hybrid Local-Cloud**: Rejected due to ZERO_COST constraint
2. **Edge Computing**: Rejected due to additional hardware costs
3. **Peer-to-Peer**: Rejected due to complexity for solo founder
