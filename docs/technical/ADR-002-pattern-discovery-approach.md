# ADR-002: Mathematical Pattern Discovery Over Rule-Based Systems

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional pattern recognition systems rely on predefined templates, rules, or supervised learning with labeled data. SOLAR EMERGENCE requires discovering unknown patterns that emerge from data without human-defined categories or rules.

## Decision
We will use mathematical discovery approaches (GNN, TDA, UMAP) that allow patterns to emerge from the topology and relationships in data, rather than matching against predefined templates.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Discovers truly novel patterns
- No human bias in pattern definition
- Patterns emerge from data structure
- Can find non-obvious relationships
- Self-improving pattern library

### Negative
- Harder to validate patterns initially
- May discover spurious correlations
- Requires more computational resources
- Less predictable outcomes
- Longer development time

## Implementation
- Graph Neural Networks for relationship discovery
- Topological Data Analysis for structure extraction
- UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Statistical validation for pattern significance
- Self-supervised learning for pattern refinement

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Template Matching**: Rejected - requires predefined patterns
2. **Supervised Learning**: Rejected - needs labeled training data
3. **Rule-Based Systems**: Rejected - limits discovery to known rules
4. **Clustering Only**: Rejected - insufficient for complex patterns
