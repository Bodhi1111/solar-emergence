# ADR-007: Architecture Optimized for Solo Founder Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
SOLAR EMERGENCE is being developed by a solo founder with limited time and resources. The architecture must balance ambition with pragmatism, enabling significant innovation while remaining manageable for one person.

## Decision
We will adopt a modular, incrementally-buildable architecture with aggressive scope management, extensive automation, and focus on core differentiating features.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Manageable development scope
- Clear priorities and phases
- Reduced complexity where possible
- Faster iteration cycles
- Sustainable development pace

### Negative
- Some features deferred to later phases
- Less redundancy in systems
- Limited parallel development
- Longer total timeline
- Single point of failure (founder)

## Implementation
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Extensive use of existing libraries
- Automated testing and deployment
- Documentation as you go
- Regular scope reviews and adjustments

## Principles
1. **Build incrementally** - Working software every week
2. **Automate aggressively** - Tests, builds, deployments
3. **Document immediately** - While context is fresh
4. **Scope ruthlessly** - Core features only
5. **Iterate quickly** - Small changes, fast feedback

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Full Team Scope**: Rejected - unrealistic for solo founder
2. **Outsourcing**: Rejected - violates cost constraints
3. **Open Source Contributors**: Rejected - coordination overhead
4. **Reduced Vision**: Rejected - loses differentiation
