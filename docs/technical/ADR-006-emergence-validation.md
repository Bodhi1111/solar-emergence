# ADR-006: Continuous Emergence Validation Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Since patterns emerge from data rather than being predefined, we need robust validation to ensure discovered patterns are meaningful, not spurious correlations. The system must demonstrate genuine intelligence emergence over time.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layer validation framework that continuously monitors pattern quality, intelligence metrics, and emergence indicators using statistical significance testing and cross-validation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Confidence in discovered patterns
- Measurable intelligence growth
- Protection against spurious correlations
- Reproducible results
- Scientific rigor

### Negative
- Additional computational overhead
- Complex validation pipeline
- Slower pattern acceptance
- May reject valid edge cases
- Requires careful threshold tuning

## Implementation
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Cross-validation across time windows
- Novelty scoring for new patterns
- Intelligence growth metrics
- Automated A/B testing framework

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual Review Only**: Rejected - not scalable
2. **Simple Threshold**: Rejected - too rigid
3. **No Validation**: Rejected - risk of false patterns
4. **External Validation Service**: Rejected - violates LOCAL_ONLY
