3. **Complexity management**: System becomes unmaintainable
   - *Mitigation*: Modular architecture, clear boundaries

4. **EH²SMAS Architecture Complexity**: Novel 511+ agent hierarchy may be too complex
   - *Mitigation*: Modular holarchical design, clear agent boundaries, incremental deployment
   
5. **Stigmergic Intelligence Scaling**: Sequential learning across 1,500 videos may cause memory/performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Optimized trace storage, intelligent caching, Mac M2 Max hardware optimization

6. **Emergent Behavior Validation**: Difficulty measuring genuine emergence vs programmed patterns
   - *Mitigation*: Formal emergence metrics, human surprise validation, pattern novelty tracking

### Implementation Risks

   - *Mitigation*: Phased approach, MVP focus

2. **Emergent behavior unpredictability**: System behaves unexpectedly
   - *Mitigation*: Careful monitoring, staged rollout

3. **Multi-level selection convergence**: Agents may not reach consensus across hierarchy levels
   - *Mitigation*: Robust consensus protocols, debate mechanisms, conflict resolution procedures
   
4. **Research novelty**: EH²SMAS architecture unproven in practice
