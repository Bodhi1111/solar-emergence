# SOLAR EMERGENCE - Enhanced Project Charter
# Generated from Constraint-Validated Knowledge Corpus

## Core Principles (IMMUTABLE)
- DISCOVERY_FIRST: Let mathematics reveal patterns, don't dictate them
- LOCAL_ONLY: Everything runs on Mac M2 Max, no cloud
- ZERO_COST: No paid APIs, services, or subscriptions
- EMERGENT: Patterns emerge from data, not from rules
- SEQUENTIAL: Each video builds on previous intelligence
- MULTIMODAL: All signals matter equally until proven otherwise

## Technical Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Hardware**: Mac M2 Max local execution
- **APIs**: NO external APIs except localhost bridges
- **Storage**: Local filesystem and Docker containers only
- **ML Models**: Local models only (MLX, local Whisper, etc)
- **Cost**: Zero recurring costs
