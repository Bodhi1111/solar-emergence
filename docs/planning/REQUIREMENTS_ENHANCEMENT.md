# Requirements Enhancement from Knowledge Corpus

## Emergent Intelligence Requirements
Based on constraint-validated knowledge extraction:

### Functional Requirements
- FR001: This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- FR002: The technique reveals hidden insights through mathematical analysis.

### Discovery Requirements  
- DR001: Unfortunately, it currently uses OpenAI API for processing.
- DR002: This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- DR003: It uses local architecture for processing video data.

### Architecture Requirements
- AR001: This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- AR002: It uses local architecture for processing video data.
