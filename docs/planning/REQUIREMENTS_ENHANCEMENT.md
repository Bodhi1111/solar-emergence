# Requirements Enhancement from Knowledge Corpus

## Emergent Intelligence Requirements
Based on constraint-validated knowledge extraction:

### Functional Requirements
- FR001: - GNN/Pattern Discovery: GNN Survey, Self-supervised Learning, TDA, UMAP
- FR002: - Core AI/ML: Transformer, AlphaGo Zero, Meta-learning, Emergent Tool Use
- FR003: Replanning: Agents can now dynamically edit their own task lists, adapting when a step fails or a be
- FR004: Plus, discoverability -- as it turns out -- is easier to address.
- FR005: it matches the developer's needs. This becomes essentially a series of pattern
- FR006: Go forth, brave module spelunker, and make your work discoverable and usable
- FR007: The pattern of README appearing in all-caps is a consistent facet throughout
- FR008: benefits from predictable patterns.
- FR009: **This is okay**. Truly. A low bar to entry and a discoverability problem is
- FR010: The Node community has responded to the challenge of discoverability in

### Discovery Requirements  
- DR001: - Whisper.cpp (local speech processing)
- DR002: > routines or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth
- DR003: No matter your approach, regardless whether a module spelunker enters the module
- DR004: methods: ["multi-objective_optimization", "constraint_propagation", "feasibility_analysis"]
- DR005: methods: ["analogical_reasoning", "creative_combination", "paradigm_shifting"]
- DR006: Adaptive Workflows: Self-modifying processes based on outcomes
- DR007: 10x Problem Solving Speed: Parallel agent processing
- DR008: method: "emergent_consensus"
- DR009: Review Enhancement Plan - Validate approach with your vision
- DR010: Adaptive Workflow Evolution: Self-improving processes

### Architecture Requirements
- AR001: Bercovici observes swarms now deliver "security audits, red teaming, compliance documentation, and e
- AR002: Bercovici, a self-proclaimed former skeptic of AGI, said he's now a believer that AGI is coming, hav
- AR003: The convergence of several distinct technological advancements are driving this sudden leap: a new g
- AR004: This new generation of agentic systems has mastered several key structural capabilities:
- AR005: By the time his flight crossed Iceland, he recounted in an interview with VentureBeat, his "Claude C
- AR006: Sophisticated Agentic Architectures:
- AR007: Model Switching: Advanced systems route sub-tasks to the most capable model for each job.
- AR008: The "swarm" is an architecture where a problem is decomposed and assigned to multiple specialized ag
- AR009: Like any ecosystem that is extremely accessible, the quality bar varies. npm
- AR010: more structured, lintable take on a common README format.

All requirements maintain compliance with SOLAR EMERGENCE constraints:
- LOCAL_ONLY, ZERO_COST, DISCOVERY_FIRST, EMERGENT
