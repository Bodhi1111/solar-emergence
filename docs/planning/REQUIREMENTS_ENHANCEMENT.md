# Requirements Enhancement from Knowledge Corpus

## Emergent Intelligence Requirements
Based on constraint-validated knowledge extraction:

### Functional Requirements
- FR001: - Core AI/ML: Transformer, AlphaGo Zero, Meta-learning, Emergent Tool Use
- FR002: - GNN/Pattern Discovery: GNN Survey, Self-supervised Learning, TDA, UMAP
- FR003: Plus, discoverability -- as it turns out -- is easier to address.
- FR004: Go forth, brave module spelunker, and make your work discoverable and usable
- FR005: it matches the developer's needs. This becomes essentially a series of pattern
- FR006: The Node community has responded to the challenge of discoverability in
- FR007: The pattern of README appearing in all-caps is a consistent facet throughout
- FR008: **This is okay**. Truly. A low bar to entry and a discoverability problem is
- FR009: benefits from predictable patterns.
- FR010: This document catalogs key open-source repositories for layered fusion and meta-data modules in mult

### Discovery Requirements  
- DR001: - Whisper.cpp (local speech processing)
- DR002: No matter your approach, regardless whether a module spelunker enters the module
- DR003: > routines or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth
- DR004: Unfortunately, it currently uses OpenAI API for processing.
- DR005: It uses local architecture for processing video data.
- DR006: This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- DR007: - Orientation methods now return current orientation. [Issue #64]
- DR008: * paid scientific consulting around speaker diarization and speech processing in general;
- DR009: training process. Adding `--cfg job` option to the previous command will let
- DR010: protocol = registry.get_protocol("AMI.SpeakerDiarization.only_words", preprocessors={"audio": FileFi

### Architecture Requirements
- AR001: equally well to other programming ecosystems, as well.
- AR002: The Node ecosystem is powered by its modules. [npm](https://npmjs.org) is the
- AR003: Node has a "wide" ecosystem: it's largely made up of a very long list of
- AR004: more structured, lintable take on a common README format.
- AR005: Like any ecosystem that is extremely accessible, the quality bar varies. npm
- AR006: state of READMEs in the Node ecosystem. It spurred me to create
- AR007: much of the internet, and both feature a wide module ecosystem.
- AR008: important but not widely known abstractions or other ecosystems. The function
- AR009: module remains a valid and valuable model for the npm ecosystem, and your
- AR010: history. In addition to the visual strikingness of using all-caps, UNIX systems

All requirements maintain compliance with SOLAR EMERGENCE constraints:
- LOCAL_ONLY, ZERO_COST, DISCOVERY_FIRST, EMERGENT
