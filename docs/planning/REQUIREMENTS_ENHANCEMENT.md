# Requirements Enhancement from Knowledge Corpus

## Emergent Intelligence Requirements
Based on constraint-validated knowledge extraction:

### Functional Requirements
- FR001: - GNN/Pattern Discovery: GNN Survey, Self-supervised Learning, TDA, UMAP
- FR002: - Core AI/ML: Transformer, AlphaGo Zero, Meta-learning, Emergent Tool Use
- FR003: Replanning: Agents can now dynamically edit their own task lists, adapting when a step fails or a be
- FR004: **This is okay**. Truly. A low bar to entry and a discoverability problem is
- FR005: The Node community has responded to the challenge of discoverability in
- FR006: The pattern of README appearing in all-caps is a consistent facet throughout
- FR007: Plus, discoverability -- as it turns out -- is easier to address.
- FR008: it matches the developer's needs. This becomes essentially a series of pattern
- FR009: benefits from predictable patterns.
- FR010: Go forth, brave module spelunker, and make your work discoverable and usable

### Discovery Requirements  
- DR001: - Whisper.cpp (local speech processing)
- DR002: No matter your approach, regardless whether a module spelunker enters the module
- DR003: > routines or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth
- DR004: It uses local architecture for processing video data.
- DR005: Unfortunately, it currently uses OpenAI API for processing.
- DR006: This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- DR007: - Orientation methods now return current orientation. [Issue #64]
- DR008: * paid scientific consulting around speaker diarization and speech processing in general;
- DR009: training process. Adding `--cfg job` option to the previous command will let
- DR010: protocol = registry.get_protocol("AMI.SpeakerDiarization.only_words", preprocessors={"audio": FileFi

### Architecture Requirements
- AR001: The "swarm" is an architecture where a problem is decomposed and assigned to multiple specialized ag
- AR002: Model Switching: Advanced systems route sub-tasks to the most capable model for each job.
- AR003: Sophisticated Agentic Architectures:
- AR004: Bercovici, a self-proclaimed former skeptic of AGI, said he's now a believer that AGI is coming, hav
- AR005: This new generation of agentic systems has mastered several key structural capabilities:
- AR006: Bercovici observes swarms now deliver "security audits, red teaming, compliance documentation, and e
- AR007: By the time his flight crossed Iceland, he recounted in an interview with VentureBeat, his "Claude C
- AR008: The convergence of several distinct technological advancements are driving this sudden leap: a new g
- AR009: more structured, lintable take on a common README format.
- AR010: state of READMEs in the Node ecosystem. It spurred me to create

All requirements maintain compliance with SOLAR EMERGENCE constraints:
- LOCAL_ONLY, ZERO_COST, DISCOVERY_FIRST, EMERGENT
