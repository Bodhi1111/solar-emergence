### Algorithms (26 items)
- - Whisper.cpp (local speech processing)
- No matter your approach, regardless whether a module spelunker enters the module
- > routines or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth
- Unfortunately, it currently uses OpenAI API for processing.
- It uses local architecture for processing video data.
- This system demonstrates emergent pattern discovery algorithms.
- - Orientation methods now return current orientation. [Issue #64]
