## Key Information Synthesis for PRD

### Technical Architecture Summary
```
Layer 1 (Sensorium): Multimodal data capture + synchronization
Layer 2 (Representation): Knowledge graph + latent space
Layer 3 (Discovery): Multi-agent pattern discovery
Layer 4 (Evolution): Self-modification capabilities
```

### Implementation Priorities
```
Phase 1 (Months 1-4): Sensorium + Data Foundation
Phase 2 (Months 4-8): Multidimensional Representation  
Phase 3 (Months 8-12): Discovery Engine Activation
Phase 4 (Months 12+): Evolution Loop Implementation
```

### Success Metrics Framework
```
Technical: >95% sync accuracy, >70% pattern correlation
Business: 25-40% conversion improvement, $500K+ revenue impact  
User: >4.5/5.0 insight relevance, >90% knowledge capture
Operational: $0 ongoing costs, <24hr insight generation
```

## PRD Template Preparation

### Section-by-Section Guidance

### Critical PRD Decisions Needed

#### Technical Specifications Detail Level
**Question for PM:** How granular should technical specifications be?
- **Option A:** High-level architecture with implementation flexibility
- **Option B:** Detailed technical specifications with specific technology choices
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid approach - detailed for Phase 1, flexible for later phases

#### User Story Granularity
**Question for PM:** What level of user story detail is needed?
- **Epic Level:** High-level workflow scenarios
- **Story Level:** Specific feature interactions
- **Task Level:** Detailed acceptance criteria
- **Recommendation:** Epic + Story level for MVP, Task level for Phase 1 features

#### Success Criteria Measurability
**Question for PM:** How will emergent intelligence be measured?
- **Quantitative Metrics:** Pattern accuracy, correlation coefficients, performance benchmarks
- **Qualitative Measures:** User satisfaction, insight relevance, competitive advantage
- **Emergent Indicators:** Novel pattern discovery, autonomous insight generation
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid framework with both quantitative and emergent measures

## Risk Mitigation for PRD Process

### Technical Complexity Management
**Issue:** Emergent intelligence complexity may exceed PRD scope definition capability
**Mitigation:** Phase-based approach with clear technical validation gates

### Solo Founder Execution Feasibility  
**Issue:** PRD scope may exceed single developer capability
**Mitigation:** Conservative MVP scope with aggressive Phase 1 focus

### Success Criteria Definition
**Issue:** Emergent intelligence success may be difficult to define in advance
**Mitigation:** Adaptive success criteria with learning-based adjustments

## BMad Agent Transition Protocol

### From Analyst (Mary) to Project Manager
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Ready for handoff
**Deliverables:**
